Extra stuff:
 - Used a mixin in exercise 3 to make truncating a BigDecimal
   similar to truncating a double.
 - In exercise 9, I noticed that the palindrome creator could
   produce shorter palindromes by not duplicating the last part
   of the string if it's palindromic, 
	eg: abcded  =>  abcdedcba  (instead of: abcdeddedcba)
 - In exercise 14, you are told if the point is inside, outside, 
   or on the border of the rectangle.
 - In exercise 15, you are again told about points on the border,
   including the rectangle representing the overlap of the first two.
